This package contains two real robotic experiments using a UR5e:
1) push experiment based on arUco marker detection
2) teleoperation experiment based on hand-landmark detection

both experiment require running similar nodes:
- the image puplisher
- the image processer
- the UR driver
- the low-level control
- the high-level control

Only the high level-control and image processer differ among both experiments.
