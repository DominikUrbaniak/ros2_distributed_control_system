## Gazebo Push Simulation

Implementation of linear push actions with UR5e, Robotiq 2F-85 gripper and custom cube using Ubuntu 22.04, ROS2 Humble and Gazebo 11. See example video, adding latency measurements from a loaded Wi-Fi 5 network (https://github.com/DominikUrbaniak/ros2_distributed_control_system/blob/main/gazebo_push_simulation/simulated_push_actions_wifi5_loaded.mp4).

## External Packages
(to be included into the workspace along the packages from this repository)
- ROS2 UR description package (ur_description), humble branch (-b humble): https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Description
- IOC-UPC inverse kinematics library for UR robots (kinenik): https://gitioc.upc.edu/robots/kinenik

## Packages in this repository
- main_pkg: setup of the gazebo environment with robot, gripper and cubes, and velocity controller, using modified launch file from https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Gazebo_Simulation, and modified multi-object launch mechanism by TheConstruct: https://bitbucket.org/theconstructcore/box_bot/src/foxy/box_bot_description/launch/
- experiments: Experiment for pushing a cube in a straight line
- custom_interfaces: Includes the custom messages and services
- robotiq_2f_model: model from https://github.com/beta-robots/robotiq/tree/master/robotiq_2f_model wrapped in ROS2 package

## Latency distributions
The [latency distributions](https://github.com/DominikUrbaniak/Latency_Push_Actions/tree/main/latency_distributions) of Ethernet and private 4G, private 5G, 5G URLLC, and ideal and loaded Wi-Fi 5 networks are owned by Aalborg University, Denmark. The usage of this data requires the citation of two papers¹.

## Run experiment

- *ros2 launch main_pkg main.launch.py*
- *ros2 run push_control_py sim_translation private5g 60 10*

Input parameters are the name of the communication technology ( *private5g* ), the sensing rate ( *60* ) and the number of episodes as inputs ( *10* ). Further parameters can be set in main_pkg/config/sim_translation.ini, such as the low-level control timeout and pushing speed.
